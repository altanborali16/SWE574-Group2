## Milestone Review 
### Summary of project status
* % of requirements not completed from the previous semester: 50%
* New features to be added to the existing product are recommendation and gamification (badges) mechanisms. They require the introduction of several supporting features (such as interests and tags for communities and posts).
* Frontend remains to be re-created to accommodate the use of desktop and mobile clients to run the app.

### Lessons learned (reflection)
**Evaluation of deliverables status and impact on the project plan:**

...

**Evaluation of tools and processes to manage the project:**
1. The project processes are managed exclusively using github tools (issues, Wiki, discussions, and [Github Project](https://github.com/users/altanborali16/projects/1/views/2)). All team members are responsible for grooming the backlog of issues assigned to them. This eliminates the need for additional "housekeeping" during meetings.
2. The team works in iterations and uses the "Iterations" feature in the Github Project to define the iteration scope.
3. Meetings are minuted, and minutes are shared on the Wiki page. This allows us to keep all team members up to date.
4. Decisions taken at meetings are recorded on a separate page [Desicions and Policies](https://github.com/altanborali16/SWE574-Group2/wiki/Decisions-&-Policies) for easy reference.
5. The team chose a project manager responsible for setting and assigning tasks and decomposing complex tasks into manageable steps. The project manager also controls deadlines and holds team members to account.
