### Weekly reports and meeting notes
Link: https://github.com/altanborali16/SWE574-Group2/wiki/Meeting-notes  
Status: continuously updated  

## Milestone Review 
### Summary of project status
* The team intended to work by transferring features from various team members' repos. This approach did not work as intended this is why corrective action was introduced after the presentation of progress on October 21.
* As of October 21, signup and secure login features were implemented, committed to git, and deployed.

### Lessons learned (reflection)
**Evaluation of deliverables status and impact on the project plan:**  
List of Deliverables and their status:  
Software Requirements Specification  - partially completed, sections VI.B and VI.C are work-in-progress  
Software Design (UML diagrams)  - partially completed
Scenarios and Mockups  - partially completed.
Project Plan, Communication Plan, Responsibility Assignment Matrix  - agreed and kept updated  
Weekly reports and any additional meeting notes  - continuously updated  
Individual Contributions  - completed  
A pre-release version of software  - completed; see details below  

Corrective action plan will allow the team to build the features missing from the previous semester; they will serve as a foundation for the development of new features (badges and recommendations) in the next development phase. See [workplan.  ](https://github.com/altanborali16/SWE574-Group2/wiki/Milestone-1-Report#work-plan)

**Evaluation of tools and processes to manage the project:**
1. The project processes are managed exclusively using github tools (issues, Wiki, discussions, and [Github Project](https://github.com/users/altanborali16/projects/1/views/2)). All team members are responsible for grooming the backlog of issues assigned to them. This eliminates the need for additional "housekeeping" during meetings.
2. The team works in iterations and uses the "Iterations" feature in the Github Project to define the iteration scope.
3. Meetings are minuted, and minutes are shared on the Wiki page. This allows us to keep all team members up to date.
4. Decisions taken at meetings are recorded on a separate page [Desicions and Policies](https://github.com/altanborali16/SWE574-Group2/wiki/Decisions-&-Policies) for easy reference.
5. The team chose a project manager responsible for setting and assigning tasks and decomposing complex tasks into manageable steps. The project manager also controls deadlines and holds team members to account.
  
### Individual Contributions (references to issues, PRs, comments, commits etc)

1. **Group Member Name: Altan** 
* **Responsibilities:** Frontend development, code revision, project communicator, project manager. Which I failed as project manager so I am no longer the project manager.
* **Main contributions:** Research and brief test page for pwa. Initial creation of Login and Register pages. Folder structure of frontend. Code refactoring and pair coding with Enes. 

* **Code-related significant issues:** All the issues with a label "component : frontend" is either done, reviewed or pair coded by.

* **Non-code-related significant issues:** Creating project on github, controlling the status of issues, adding issues to iterations. Joined Feridun's deployment process to understand how to deploy project.

* **Pull requests that you have created, merged, and reviewed.** I tried to merge initial-frontend branch to dev-frontend which I had conflicts and could not manage to resolve them, I asked Efe for help and thanks for him he manages my merge.

The first major conflict happened while I was trying to push my feature to the dev branch. I have spent hours and had many commits at feature/efe-33-build-security-configuration, due to origin & remote conflict when I switched to the main all my code disappeared and I could not revert back due to ambiguity. After spending countless hours learning and understanding local & remote commit history differences I was able to navigate a previous commit that had the majority of the code. I deleted conflicting files from my repository then I was able to switch to the previous commit. I created a new branch and prepared a tutorial for other members. Even though we have a tutorial now, we have decided to make sure branch ops are handled by the most experienced (traumatized :( )

The second major conflict happened while we were trying to combine the backend and frontend under one branch to have an easier time deploying them to EC2.
Altan tried to merge his branch login-initial-build to dev-backend-deployment and had the exact same problem I had previously. Thanks to our experience we have quickly fixed it by creating a clean branch fetching it and then pushing local codes manually and moving on to our deployment.

* **Additional information:** We have decided to have a bit harsher leading method during the week extension period. I was elected to supervise and plan our significant sprint. 
I created new rules and policies to make sure we delivered the work and experienced no major issues we had previously.

4. **Group Member Name: Enes** 
* **Responsibilities:** Frontend development, code revision, mockup design, documentation
* **Main contributions:** I was one of the responsibles for the initial development of the Login and Register pages together with Altan.  I was also responsible for designing the UI of the project. You can see the UI designs [Here.](https://github.com/altanborali16/SWE574-Group2/wiki/Designs,-diagrams,-and-use-case-scenarios#ui-mockup-designs)
 
* **Code-related significant issues:** Understanding how Bootstrap works was a little bit challenging for me.I am still trying to improve myself. I also took some time to implement validations on the frontend as I did not know how to do it. I and Altan decided to use Yup library for implementing validations on the login/register pages so we have gone through some of Yup implementation videos from several sources.

Here is the list of commits that is done by me as far as the frontend development is concerned.

1. [Commit a44c6f](https://github.com/altanborali16/SWE574-Group2/commit/a44c6f5215cdcfd885d1fc17a8cd6b9374db9dfb)

* **Non-code-related significant issues:** I gave several suggestions on how the recommendation system and badge system will work and how it's going to look like on the frontend.

* **Pull requests that you have created, merged, and reviewed.** I have not took any role in pull requests as Altan did it already.
